            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Version Control is a system that records changes to a file or set of files over time so that you can recall specific versions later. There are three versions of version control systems local, centralized, and distributed. Local version control is to keep all files on the same computer but in a different directory; a centralized system is where there is one dedicated server that can be accessed by others. A distributed version control system is what Git is, where the files are fully mirrored version of the repository. Each method has it pros and cons, the most secure (best) method is to use a distributed, because on a centralized version control if the server goes down no user can access files till the server is back. </p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Git is a free software distributed under the terms of the GNU General Public License, originally designed by Linux kernel developers including Linus Torvalds. Git is distributed version control system, focused on speed and data integrity without discriminating on the size of the job. Git has unique way of storing data instead of making a new file every time it makes a "snapshot" of any change you make to the file and it saves those in easy to view formats.  Git uses a three stage system, a working directory, staging area, and the repository. The working directory is where the user inputs its changes, the staging area is where git determines whether or not to make a snapshot, and the repository is where the new snapshots are uploaded.   </p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">A repository is a central location in which data is stored and managed. There are multiple types of repositories in a version control system, there is remote repository's which reside on a remote server that is shared among multiple teams via local repository's. A local repository's is a repository that is on a user's local machine and usually used to connect a remote repository. A repository allows users to view previous versions of all previous versions of a file that was saved into the repository, meaning a file can not be overwritten but instead there are multiple versions of the same file saved in the repository, the latest version of all files are held in the common repository. </p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Git data storage is a bit different than what you imagine, instead of storing multiple types of the same file, they instead save a "snapshot" of the changes you make to and allow you to access it that way, if no changes occur then Git will not save but instead just link back to the last version. Git does not care of the size of the project it stores all files in the same snapshot method, focusing on speed and data integrity as always, making Git one of the best version control systems available. </p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">
Git commands are how users upload files from the local project to the remote repository, with three basic steps: add, commit, and push. You can use commands to do a multitude of different things such a create a new local repository, check an existing repository, add files, commit, push, and many more. A user can also perform branch commands such as making new branches, switching between branches, merging existing branches, and deleting branches. With all of these commands, or tools, the user has the utmost control over their repository and can design it to be exactly what the envisioned to help their project work seamlessly as intended. </p>
